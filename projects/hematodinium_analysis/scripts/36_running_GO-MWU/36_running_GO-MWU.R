# We will run GO-MWU twice - once for each comparison

# After each analysis, move the output files from the 06_running_GO-MWU directory into an output folder.

# I know, I know - suboptimal to have setwd(). 
# I assume that all scripts start from within your scripts directory, 
# so this just indicates that you need to move to the same subdirectory
# as all other GO-MWU files - both data files and analysis files.
# GO-MWU doesn't cooperate otherwise.
