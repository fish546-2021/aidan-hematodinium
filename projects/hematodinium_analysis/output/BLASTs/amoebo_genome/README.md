Sequences were BLASTed against a database consisting of the genome for _Amoebophrya sp._

Filename is formatted as follows:

Sequence_Evalue_BlastTyperes.tab

For instance, when a BLASTn was performed on cbai_transcriptome_v2.0 (AKA cbai_hemat_transcriptome_v2.0) with an e-value of 10^-5, the resulting filename is cbai2.0_eval10_5_blastnres.tab
