Downloads of all publicly-available nucleotide sequences within particular taxa

Alveolata and Arthropoda were chosen as sequences because they are broad taxa which contain _Hematodinium sp._ and _Chionoecetes bairdi_, respectively. 

Both were downloaded from the [NCBI taxonomy browser](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cg) as FASTA files
