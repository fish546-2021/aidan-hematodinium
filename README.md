This repository contains a series of smaller projects completed as part of Steven Roberts' Bioinformatics class at UW-SAFS, Winter 2021. Projects are all contained in subdirectories within projects/

**Projects and Assignments**

**2021-01-18_Intro_to_Blastx**: 

Compared a set of nucleotide sequences to Swiss-Prot sequences using BLAST. All relevant code in Jupyter Notebook within folder. 

Nucleotide sequences downloaded from [here](https://eagle.fish.washington.edu/cnidarian/Ab_4denovo_CLC6_a.fa) at 20:00 PST on 2021-01-18. Command is documented within Jupyter notebook.

Swiss-Prot sequences downloaded from [here](ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/current_release/knowledgebase/complete/uniprot_sprot.fasta.gz) at 19:00 PST on 2021-01-18. Command and MD5 checksum are documented in Jupyter notebook.

**2021-01-25_Data_Exploration** 

Practiced exploring .fastq files running FastQC on a .fastq library. Nucleotide sequence downloaded from [here](http://owl.fish.washington.edu/nightingales/C_bairdi/72_R1_001.fastq.gz) on 2021-01-25

**hematodinium_analysis** 

This is an offshoot of my research for the Roberts lab so far. The central aim is to analyze differential expression in _Hematodinium_. Samples are taken from _Hematodinium_-infected _Chionoecetes bairdi_. To view the most up-to-date information, please go to [my main repo](https://github.com/afcoyle/hemat_bairdii_transcriptome). If you are looking for more detailed information as part of FISH 546, in-depth info describing process/workflow/plan for the future is found in the README file within the projects/hematodinium_analysis directory of this repository.
